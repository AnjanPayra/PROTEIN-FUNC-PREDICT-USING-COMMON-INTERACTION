YNL236w|YDR477w|The interaction between Snf1 and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme provides a novel mechanism for modulating the transcriptional response to glucose depletion. This mechanism probably acts in concert with other Snf1-dependent mechanisms involving transcription repressors and activators but provides a "shortcut" between the kinase and the holoenzyme.
