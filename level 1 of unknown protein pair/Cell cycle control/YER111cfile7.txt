YER111c|YLR182w|a carboxy-terminal domain of Swi6p is required and sufficient for interaction with Swi4; affinity column; collaborates with Swi4p to form the SBF factor for regulation at the cell cycle box (CCB) element; carboxy terminus is sufficient for interaction wit
YER111c|YPR119w|interaction with Clb2p is Swi6p-independent; interacts with Clb2/Cdc28 kinase during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle; the ankyrin repeats mediate the interaction with Clb2/Cdc28 kinase
