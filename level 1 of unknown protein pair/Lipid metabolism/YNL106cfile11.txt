YIL002c|YNL106c|inp51 inp52 inp53 triple mutant is inviable on standard medium but can grow weakly in medium supplemented with 1 M sorbitol
YNL106c|YOR109w|INP52 overexpression suppresses the vacuolar phenotype of inp53 and inp52 inp53 mutants; inp52 inp53 double null mutant shows more severe vacuolar defect than inp53 single null mutant
